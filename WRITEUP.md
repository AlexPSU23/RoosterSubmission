Hello,
Hope you are doing well. I'm Alexandr Znamensky. Here are my answers to the three given questions:


Questions:
1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

3. What you enjoyed the most and why

Answers:
1. I primarily used html, css, and javascript since I am most familiar with them. I may have used boostrap since boostrap would save time on some of the functionality of the website (carousel as an example). 

2. Using purely html and css was very time consuming. Also, implementing an adequate grid system was a struggle for me since I was not very familiar with the concept. 

3. I enjoyed learning new things such as implementing a “display grid” and working on the carousel’s behavior. I also worked on a dark-mode feature; however, it didn’t look very good since the pictures are bright and it set a Halloween tone (default orange and purple colors combined with black).
